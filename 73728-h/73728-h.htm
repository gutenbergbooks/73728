<p class="p2 drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">mong</span> his many titles to the
special consideration and gratitude
of his countrymen, James Russell
Lowell had one in pre-eminence—an unyielding
loyalty to all that was best in
American ideas and aims. It was this
quality that gave point to the wit of
Hosea Biglow, and loftiness to his imagination
in his more serious poems. In
the earliest of the Biglow papers, he
calls upon Massachusetts to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0a">“Hold up a beacon peerless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the oppressed of all the World,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and the tone is not changed to his very
latest utterance. In that Commemoration
Ode, which will remain the crown
of his literary and poetical work, his
passion found its highest expression:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“O Beautiful! My Country! * * *</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smoothing thy gold of war-dishevelled hair</div>

 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
An impression has prevailed—and
has gained credence at some times
and in some places, that, in his later years,
and in the presence of a society differently
organized from that which he found
at home, the ardor of his love of country
was quenched:—that he became less
an American as he saw more of other
lands. What is it to be an American?
The definition may vary, in different
regions. What was it, always, with
him? If to be an American means
merely to be successful in a large
and worldly way—whether in politics,
or in business, or in letters; to out-talk,
out-spend, out-bid, out-invent
others; to drive faster; to travel
farther; to push harder; to build
bigger houses; to found more richly endowed
Universities; to construct greater
Observatories; to establish more and larger
public libraries:—if to do these and
similar things is all that goes to make
an American—the charge is true. In
such sense, Mr. Lowell was not so good
an American as some others. But, in
the larger and truer sense:—in striving
for all that goes to make a people more
noble in aim, more humane, more intelligent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
more peace-loving, more free, more
self-respecting, more artistic, in short
more fully men and women of the best
type,—Mr. Lowell may well be accepted
as the representative American, of whom
we should all be proud.</p>

<p>It was his rare fortune to be Minister of
the United States to Great Britain during
a most interesting period. The serious
troubles which had grown out of the
wrong we had suffered at her hands during
the civil war had been happily ended.
The era of reconciliation had begun. In
what light should we stand before the
world, after winning the great verdict
in the Alabama case:—as a community
of sharp traders, condoning a great national
wrong for a petty sum of money?—or
as a people striving chiefly for
the maintenance of the true principles of
national honor and international comity?
Mr. Lowell, perhaps more than any
one in America, was the man who,
by training, by culture, by scholarship,
by attainments in the world of letters,
by unsullied character, was fitted to present
to the English people an embodiment
of Americanism, in its best expression.
More than that:—he was eminently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
fitted to illustrate that idea, and
give it weight, dignity and authority.
In all his intercourse with the aristocratic
representatives of privileged
countries, he—the plain, untitled representative
of a democratic government—proud
to stand for a people with whom
liberty and equality were supreme terms—more
than held his own in every trial
of intellect, of courtesy, of wit, of all
that wins in society and the world. So,
at last, no circle was complete without
him:—to claim him as guest was matter
of emulation.</p>

<p>Some of these things are, in a certain
sense, of small account. Yet in a society
so largely conventional as all diplomatic
society is, and of necessity must
be, it is much that an American should,
by common consent, stand at the head,
even in matters of ceremonial. It reveals
a quickness and versatility of
mind which is not common. A certain
native, spontaneous grace, both of words
and manner, characterized all Mr. Lowell’s
utterances; and it was so truly
genuine that it could not fail to
charm, when the mere external imitation
was sure to repel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
The record which this little book gives
of his unstudied speeches and letters in
England shows how thoroughly imbued
he was with the American idea. It also
shows how strenuously he used every occasion
to try to bring about a higher and
truer friendship between the two great
countries whose mission it seems to be
to uphold and extend regulated liberty
throughout the world. Some of these
speeches were made while he was
still accredited Minister to Great
Britain: others, after he had ceased to
hold the title, though he remained in
reality the true American representative
to that people. There is, perhaps, no
other instance of a citizen of the United
States holding such position, with ever
increasing regard, for years after he had
ceased to be titular representative. The
honors bestowed on him by the Universities
were more than out-done by the
honor in which he was held by the
people. The one was a tribute to
scholarship and attainments:—the
other, a recognition of manhood and
integrity.</p>

<p>In the heroic years which made up so
large a part of the experience of all men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
in the United States from 1861 to 1865,
Mr. Lowell’s part was as efficient as that
of many a general on the battle field.
When the era of peace and reconciliation
came, he maintained the same lofty
principles which had prompted all his
former actions and words. The spirit
which dictated “The Present Crisis” so
long ago as 1845, also dictated the
“Fourth of July Ode” in 1876. But
how different the tone of these two impassioned
lyrics! The one a vigorous,
manly, resistless protest against the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Sons of brutish Force and Darkness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who have drenched the earth with blood,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The other, a sublime thanksgiving for
the salvation of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Land to Human Nature dear.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is in the light of these strenuous outbursts
of the unconquered spirit of independence
that his words spoken in lighter
vein are to be read and considered.
Everywhere is the same faith and hope:—only,
in these later speeches, they
find expression in words fitted for social
pleasantry and genial intercourse.</p>

<p>Nowhere do after-dinner speeches—which,
with us, are usually momentary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
and evanescent in effect—carry so
much weight as in England. There
often a public dinner is an event. Questions
of peace or war: of party policy: of
methods of administration: of national
destiny, are often decided or directed
by words spoken at the dinner table.
Therefore, these speeches of Mr. Lowell
have a much greater significance than if
made on similar occasions with us.
In every one is to be found an earnest
endeavor, first to secure a higher
appreciation of his country than he
found prevailing among that insular and
self-contained people:—and next to encourage
and stimulate the formation of
a real and sincere friendship between
the mother country and her over-grown
child. He gained these ends by the exercise
of unfailing tact, courtesy and
courage, which first disarmed criticism;
and then by presenting considerations
which commanded respect and carried
conviction. Even his American humor
gained the appreciation of these lovers of
<cite>Punch</cite>.</p>

<p>The first of the speeches which are
here given was made in 1880—the last
in 1888. One invariable note is struck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
in them all. Beginning with that at
Edinburgh, he claims—what we all
conceive to be true—that the traditions
of English freedom and English civilization
have not only been maintained, but
also extended, among us: and he refers,
with evident and just pride, to the quick
and intelligent appreciation of Carlyle
in America, long before he won recognition
in his own England. And, in his
last speech, on the eve of leaving Liverpool
to return home, he dwells with
great earnestness on the duty laid on
English-speaking races everywhere to
carry with them the great lessons of
liberty combined with order.</p>

<p>In all these evidently unstudied and
spontaneous expressions of his permanent
feeling and conviction, Mr. Lowell
claims our hearty consideration. His
voice is everywhere and always loyal to
his native land, which he loved and
honored: to freedom, which he held
above all price: to that liberty and civilization
which it is the joint mission of England
and America to maintain to the
uttermost. Difference of methods between
the two countries there may be:
but the end to be reached is the same.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
To help reach this, Mr. Lowell gave his
best energies. His words had a power
beyond what he could have thought
possible. If there is now, in England, a
clearer appreciation of American ideas:
less of that condescension which was
once so evident in foreigners: more
readiness to see and to seek the best
rather than the worst in our modes of
life and thought: a clearer understanding
that, at heart, we are one people—a
very large share of that improved condition
is due to James Russell Lowell.
The method of securing that better understanding
was—not by denying or ignoring
certain manifest short-comings or
over-doings:—but by constantly holding
up to the world the best we had done, or
striven to do:—and, more than all, by
illustrating it in his own person:—so
that even our enemies were compelled
to confess that there must be some good
in our land, if such men as he were the</p>

<p class="center allsmcap tall">BEFORE THE EDINBURGH PHILOSOPHICAL
INSTITUTION.</p>


<p class="p2 drop-cap">O<span class="smcap">n</span> Saturday evening, November 6,
1880, the directors of the Edinburgh
Philosophical Institution
entertained Mr. <span class="smcap">James Russell Lowell</span>,
American Minister, at dinner in the Balmoral
Hotel in that city. Dr. W. Smith,
senior vice-president of the institution,
occupied the chair, and among others
present were the Earl of Rosebery, Lord
Reay, Principal Sir Alexander Grant, the
Rev. Professor Flint, and Professor
Blackie. Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowell</span>, in returning
thanks for the toast of his health, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He thought that they in America
had done quite their share of work in
their short life, although he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
always inclined to question the statement
that they were a young people.
It was supposed, somehow or other,
that they were autochthonic; that
they had sprung from the earth of
America, as the Athenians were
said to have done from the soil
of Attica. But it was nothing of
the kind. If he might be allowed to
say so, they began where those in
this country left off. It must be remembered
that they took with them
all the traditions of English freedom
and of English civilization, and that
they not only maintained them, but,
in his humble judgment, carried
them further. (<i>Cheers.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowell</span> concluded by referring to
early association on his part with Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Afterwards, proposing “The health of
Mr. Carlyle and the Philosophical Institution
of Edinburgh,” Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowell</span> said
that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>America in a certain sense performed
the office of posterity to England
and Scotland. Their authors
were first recognized across the Atlantic.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) He would not say
it was owing to quicker perception,
but rather to their clearness of
atmosphere (<i>laughter</i>) that they had
this luck sometimes. He remembered
particularly a book which was
published while he was still at college,
and which produced in his young
mind as great a ferment as it did
among all his contemporaries. That
book was “Sartor Resartus.” (<i>Cheers.</i>)
It was first collected and published in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
the year 1836 in the city of Boston,
in the United States of
America (<i>cheers</i>); and it there received
its first approbation. Their
chairman, Dr. Smith, had told him
during the course of the evening
that when “Sartor Resartus” first
began to appear in <cite>Fraser’s Magazine</cite>
the editor received two letters, one
from an Irishman, if he was not mistaken,
saying that if that particular
kind of stuff—describing it with what
usually began with a “d” (<i>laughter</i>)—was
to be continued he wished his
subscription to be stopped. The other
letter was from an American, saying
that if the writer of “Sartor Resartus”
in <cite>Fraser’s Magazine</cite> had written
anything else he wished it all to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
be sent to him. (<i>Laughter.</i>) The
second writer was a man he knew
well—Ralph Waldo Emerson.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) He remembered being
very much struck many years ago
with something which Thackeray said
to him. It was that Carlyle was his
master. That was said nearly thirty
years ago. The other day he took up
a number of the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>,
and in an article by Mr. Ruskin he
observed that he said Carlyle was
his master. This coincidence, the difference
between Thackeray and Ruskin
being remembered, only showed,
he thought, the universality of Carlyle’s
influence. (<i>Cheers.</i>) He meant
to say that Carlyle approached different
men on different sides, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
was one of the strongest marks that
could be mentioned of genius. Carlyle
had found an approach to their
intellects and to their hearts, to the
intellects and hearts of a great variety
of men of different nations. He had
introduced a new style—a peculiarly
English style—of looking at things,
quite as much as Sir Walter Scott introduced
a new style of novel-writing.
Sir Walter Scott, he considered, was
the greatest story-teller of the age.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) Carlyle had the surprising
gift of expressing poetic thought

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap tall">BEFORE THE LONDON CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE.</p>


<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> second annual dinner of the
London Chamber of Commerce,
which was incorporated in 1881, was held
on the evening of January 29, 1883, in
the Cannon-street Hotel, the Right Hon.
H. C. E. Childers, M. P., Chancellor of
the Exchequer, in the chair. The company,
which numbered about 180, included
representatives not only of the
great commercial communities of London
and all the most important of our
colonies, but of the English-speaking
race in every part of the world.</p>

<p>On the chairman’s left sat the Hon. <span class="smcap">J.
Russell Lowell</span>, D. C. L., United States
Minister.</p>

<p>In proposing “The Chambers of Commerce
of the United Kingdom and of
the Whole World,” he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman, my Lords and
Gentlemen</span>,—I was a few moments
ago discussing with my excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
friend upon the left what a diplomatist
might be permitted to say, and I
think the result of the discussion
was that he was left to his choice
between saying nothing that had
any meaning or saying something
that had several—(<i>laughter</i>); and
as one of those diplomatists to
whom the Under Secretary for
Foreign Affairs alluded a short
time ago I should rather choose the
latter course, because it gives one
afterwards a selection when the time
for explanation comes round. (<i>Laughter.</i>)
I shall not detain you long, for
I know that there are speakers both
on the right and on the left of me
who are impatient to burst the
bud; and I know that I have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
been selected for the pleasant duty
that has been assigned to me for any
merits of my own. (<i>Cries of dissent.</i>)
You will allow me to choose my
own reason, gentlemen. I repeat,
I have not been chosen so much for
my own merits as for the opportunity
afforded you of giving expression
to your kindness and good feeling
towards the country I represent—(<i>cheers</i>)—a
country which exemplifies
what the colonies of England may
come to if they are not wisely treated.
(<i>Laughter and cheers.</i>) Speaking for
myself and for one or two of my compatriots
whom I see here present, I
should certainly say that that was no
unpleasant destiny in itself. But I
do not, nor do my countrymen, desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
that those great commonwealths
which are now joined to England by
so many filial ties should ever be separated
from her.</p>

<p>I am asked to-night to propose the
“Chambers of Commerce of the
United Kingdom and of the World,”
and I might, if the clock did not
warn me against it—(“<em>Go on</em>”)—if
my own temperament did not stand
a little in the way—I might say to
you something very solemn on the
subject of commerce. I might say
how commerce, if not a great civilizer
in itself, had always been a great intermediary
and vehicle of civilization.
I might say that all the great commercial
States have been centres of
civilization, and centres of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
forces which keep civilization from
becoming stupid. I do not say
which is the <em>post</em> and which the
<em>propter</em> in this inference; but I do
say that the two things have been
almost invariably associated.</p>

<p>One word as to commerce in another
relation which touches me more
nearly. Commerce and the rights
and advantages of commerce, ill understood
and ignorantly interpreted,
have often been the cause of animosities
between nations. But commerce
rightly understood is a great pacificator;
it brings men face to face for
barter. It is the great corrector of
the eccentricities and enormities of
nature and of the seasons, so that a
bad harvest and a bad season in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
is a good season for Minnesota,
Kansas and Manitoba.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, I will not detain
you longer. It gives me great pleasure
to propose, as the representative
of the United States, the toast of
“The Chambers of Commerce of the
United Kingdom and of the Whole
World,” with which I associate the
names of Mr. C. M. Norwood, <abbr title="Member of Parliament">M. P.</abbr>,
vice-president of the Associated
Chambers of the United Kingdom,
and the Hon. F. Strutt, president of
the Derby Chamber. (<i>Cheers.</i>)</p>

<h3><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h3>
</div>

<p class="center allsmcap tall">AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> University of Cambridge having
under comparatively recent regulations
given archæology a definitely-recognized
position among the subjects for the
Classical Tripos examination, has now
advanced another important step by establishing
a suitable home for classical
studies, and under the same roof has
provided a home for the antiquarian and
ethnological collections of the University.
For the past eleven years classical
archæology has been systematically
taught, but what was previously carried
on under difficulties has been since
1884 pursued under advantageous circumstances.
New buildings were formally
opened May 6, 1884, by the Vice-Chancellor.
Brief addresses were made
by the Vice-Chancellor and Prof. Colvin.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowell</span> then said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He also regretted with the Vice-Chancellor,
both on his own account
and on theirs, the absence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
French Ambassador, who could have
spoken on archæological subjects
from the position of a master. He
had been asked to say a few words,
and with sincerity he could say that
it always gave him great pleasure to
be the herald that brought to the old
home a message from the new. That
scarlet gown, which had suddenly converted
him into a flaming minister
(<i>laughter</i>), reminded him that Cambridge
had adopted him as one of
her children. (<i>Cheers.</i>) He therefore
felt charged to bring a message
from the new Cambridge in the New
World—a message of filial respect—to
the old Cambridge in the Old
World. There was also a propriety
in his being there, from the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
a great deal of the interest which had
been felt in this undertaking had been
stimulated by the lectures and the
labors of a countryman of his own.
Having said this, he might naturally
be expected to take his seat, but he
knew he was not expected to do so.
He was compelled, like the Ancient
Mariner, to go on with his story,
whether he would or not. He often
thought of the African and the monkey.
The African had a notion that
the monkey could speak if he would,
but that he would not let anybody
know he could, for fear he should be
made to work. Now, he had to acknowledge
a sort of prophylactic taciturnity.
He had only one word which
had some bearing on the subject. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
was exceedingly interested in going
through the museum, under the able
guidance of Professor Colvin. The
whole arrangement of it interested
him. Each cast, almost from the
rude fetish to the highest conception
of the human brain and the human
hand, was very striking. It was
more than striking; it was most
hopeful and encouraging. As he
walked through the museum he could
not help remembering that 60 years
ago he saw in the museum at Boston
some casts from the antique, and the
ignorant delight which they first gave
to his eye; he remembered also the
education they gave to his eye as he
grew older, and he should never forget
that debt. These impressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
were of greater value and much more
operative when made early. He was
struck, in going through the museum
with Professor Colvin, with the vital
relation between æsthetic archæology
(if they would allow him to call it so),
as represented in the museum, and
Greek literature. It seemed to him
that what one felt always when
brought into contact with the work of
Grecian hands or the production of
the Grecian brain was its powerful
vitality. By powerful vitality he did
not mean merely the life in itself, but
the vitality which it communicated.
Here, it seemed to him, was the
great value of being brought into
more intimate relation with the
Greeks. When he was looking that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
morning on the statue of Nikê, the
original of which stands at the head
of the great staircase in the Louvre,
it seemed to him that it ought to be
the figure of one who stood on the
prow of the ship which brought the
news of the victory of Salamis. It
was not by any means certain, mixed
race that we were, that the existence
of a museum like that at Cambridge
would not stir in some one an ancestral
vigor, some hereditary quality or
faculty that should make him into an
artist.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></h3>
</div>
<p class="center allsmcap">ON ROBERT BROWNING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> fashion of this world passed
away, but the fashion of those
things which belonged to the world of
imagination—and it was most emphatically
in that world that Mr.
Browning had worked—endured and
never passed. In 1848 Mr. Browning
said in a preface to a collection of his
poems that many of them were out
of print and of the rest a great number
had been withdrawn from circulation,
which implied that even at
that time the size of his public was
very small. But he had fully demonstrated
that he stood in no need of a
Browning Society to reinforce his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
native vigor, for, in spite of the indifference
of the public, he had constantly
gone on, from that time to
this, producing and deepening the
impression which he had made upon
all thinking minds. It had been said
that he had no sense of form, but
this question depended upon the
meaning to be attached to that word.
One thing he thought was certain,
and that was that men who had discussed
form most, as for instance
Goethe, had not always been the
most successful in producing examples
of it. Certainly no one with
any sense of form could call “Faust”
other than formless. If form meant
the use of adequate and harmonious
means to produce a certain artistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
end, then he knew no one who had
given truer examples of it than the
great poet after whom that society
took its name. He thought there
was one danger in a Browning Society,
which was that it might lead them to
be partisans, and he thought he had
seen some symptoms of it. They
might be apt to insist upon people
admiring the inferior work of the
artist with his better work, and this
he thought would be an evil. Every
one who read Browning with attention,
and who loved him, must at the
same time admit that he was occasionally
whirled away by the sweep
and torrent of his own abundance.
But after making these deductions,
there was no poet who had given us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
a greater variety or who had shown
more originality. Mr. Browning
abided with them. He was not a
fashion, nor did he belong to any one
period of their lives. What they felt
more clearly than anything else was
his strength. He was of all others a
masculine, a virile poet.</p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap tall">AT THE UNVEILING OF THE GRAY
MEMORIAL.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> following address was delivered
on the occasion of the unveiling of
the bust of the poet Gray in the hall of
Pembroke College, Cambridge, May 26,
1885:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been asked to say a few
words, but they must be very few, as
the train is waiting for me that takes
me back to keep an engagement.
Mr. Gosse has told you he has
been present at many memorial unveilings,
and the newspapers inform
me that I also have been present at
the unveiling of perhaps too many.
But never have I been present on
any occasion with more pleasure than
on this. You have now, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
words which Lord Houghton quoted,
and which I would extend in a wider
sense than he did, a beautiful memorial
to Gray in permanent form. We
also, thanks to Mr. Gosse, possess a
photograph of this memorial in permanent
form. But we have in our
hearts and memories, I think, a
memorial to the man quite as true
and quite as permanent—that is,
permanent for us. Very few words
are fitting on an occasion which commemorates
the one of the English
poets who has written less and
pleased more perhaps than any other.
There is a certain appropriateness in
my speaking here to-day. I come
here to speak simply as the representative
of several countrymen and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
countrywomen of mine who have renewed
that affirmation, which I like
always to renew, of the unity of our
English race by giving something
more solid than words in commemoration
of the poet they loved. And,
I think there is another claim which
I perhaps have for speaking here
to-day, and that is that the most
picturesque anecdote relative to the
life of Gray—perhaps the most picturesque
related of the life of any
poet, certainly of any English poet—belongs
to the Western hemisphere;
I mean the anecdote which connects
the name of Wolfe with that of Gray.
Nothing could have been more picturesque
than the surroundings of
that saying of Wolfe’s—of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
English hero—and nothing could
have been more momentous than the
action and the consequence that followed
from it, and which made the
United States, which I have lately
represented, possible. That, I think,
gives me a certain right also to speak
here.</p>

<p>I know that sometimes criticisms
are made upon Gray. I think
I have often heard him called by
some of our juniors “commonplace.”
Upon my word, I think it a compliment.
I think it shows a certain
generality of application in what
Gray has done, for if there is one
thing more than another—I say
this to the young men whom I see
seated around both sides of the hall—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
insures the lead in life, it is
the commonplace. I have to measure
my poets, my authors, by their lasting
power, and I find Gray has a
great deal of it. He not only pleases
my youth and my age, but he pleases
other people’s youth and age; and I
cannot help thinking this is a proof
that he touches on human nature at
a great many periods and at a great
many levels, and, perhaps, that is as
high a compliment as can be paid to
the poet. There is, I admit, a certain
commonplaceness of sentiment
in his most famous poem, but I think
there is also a certain commonplaceness
of sentiment in some verses that
have been famous for more than 3000
years. I think that when Homer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
saw somebody smiling through her
tears he said, on the whole, a commonplace
thing, but it touched our
feelings for a great many centuries;
and I think that in the “Elegy in a
Country Churchyard” Gray has expressed
a simple sentiment, and as
long as there are young men and
middle-aged men, Gray’s poem will
continue to be read and loved as in
the days when it was written. There
is a Spanish proverb which rebukes
those people who ask something
better than bread. Let those who
ask for something better get something
better than what Gray produced.
For my own part I ask nothing
better. He was, perhaps, the
greatest artist in words that English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
literature has possessed. In conclusion,
let me say one word for myself.
This will probably be the last
occasion on which I shall have the
opportunity of addressing Englishmen
in public; and I wish to express
my heartfelt gratitude for the kindness
which has surrounded me both
in my official and private life, and to
say that while I came here as a far-off
cousin, I feel you are sending me
away as something like a brother.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> following reply from the Hon.
<span class="smcap">J. Russell Lowell</span> to an address
presented to him by the Mayor of
Worcester on behalf of the citizens was

Town Council on the evening of June 2,

minutes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen</span>,—While
I cannot but feel highly honored
by the beautiful proof you have
just given me that I am not forgotten
by the ever-faithful city, I value even
more the kindly sentiment which
prompted it, and to which you have
given such graceful expression. I
am well aware that it is to what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
represent far more than to any merit
of my own that I owe this distinction,
and that consciousness makes it
doubly grateful to me. They who
endured exile and danger and every
form of hardship to found the great
kindred commonwealth beyond the
sea—and what that exile must have
been they only can feel who know
how beautiful and how justly dear
was the land they left—took with
them, not only such seeds as would
bear good fruit for the body, but those
also of many a familiar flower that
could serve only as food for sentiment
and affection. Yet the most
precious gems of all were those of
memory and tradition, that had the gift
of fern-seed to go with them invisibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>They could not forget the land of
their birth, nor can we, their descendants,
forget the land of our ancestry.
They fondly gave the old names to the
new hamlets they were planting in
the wilderness. The central county
of my native State is a namesake of
yours. It calls itself proudly the
heart of the Commonwealth, and its
beautiful chief city is Worcester.
You knew how to touch a chord of
tenderest association when, four
years ago, you claimed me as of
Worcestershire because my forefathers
(the Lowells) had been so.
You have been pleased, Sir, to say
that I have done something to
strengthen the good feeling between
the two great households of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
English family. I am glad to think
that I in any way deserve this praise,
for I look upon that good feeling as
of vital interest to the best hopes and
aspirations of mankind. I am sure
that you will find my excellent successor
animated by the same sentiment,
and as happy as I have always
been, while warmly loyal to the country
that is and should be the dearest
of all, to recognize ties of blood, of
language, and of kindred institutions
which make England the next dearest.</p>

<p>As for me, Sir, the precious gift
you have brought me, truly illuminated
by its charming picture of buildings,
some of them dear for their
beauty, some because they recall your
kindness or that of friends who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
made me feel as if, when I went to
Worcester, I was going home, is only
another witness of that universal
kindness (may I not say affection?)
by which the land of my fathers
has gone near to make me fancy that
I was a son rather than a far-off
cousin. As such it will always be
justly dear to me and mine.</p>

city of Worcester, I remain, etc.,</p>

<p class="center allsmcap tall">ON INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">A <span class="smcap">numerous</span> deputation from the
Workmen’s Peace Association,
headed by Mr. W. R. Cremer, waited on
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowell</span>, at the official residence in
Albemarle street, on the evening of June
6, 1885, for the purpose of presenting to
him an address preparatory to his leaving
England for the United States. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Lowell</span>, in reply, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been exceedingly touched
latterly by the kindness which I have
received here in England from all
classes, but never have I been more
profoundly touched than by the deputation
that has now waited upon me
to express the kind wishes of the
English Workingmen. I have twice
had the pleasure of addressing working
men since I have been in England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and I have been gratified to find
that, among all the audiences to
whom I have spoken, there were
none more intelligent. They were exceedingly
quick to catch all points and
exceedingly agreeable to talk to.</p>

<p>You must not think that I have
forgotten the part taken by the working
men of England during our civil
war—I won’t say on behalf of the
North, because now we are a united
people—on the side of good order
and freedom; and on the only occasion
when I had an opportunity of
saying so—that was when speaking
to the provincial press in London—I
alluded to the subject. I agree with
you entirely on the importance of a
good understanding and much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
between England and the United
States, and between the two chief
branches of the Anglo-Saxon race.
I think you exaggerate a good
deal of my own merit in relation
to anything of that sort, but I
have always had a feeling about me
that a war between the two countries
would be a civil war, and I believe a
cordial understanding between them
to be absolutely essential, not only to
the progress of reasonable liberty,
but its preservation and its extension
to other races. (<i>Hear, hear.</i>)</p>

<p>It is a particular pleasure to me on
another account to meet English
workmen. I notice that, however
ardent they may be in their aspirations
and however theoretical on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
some points, they are always reasonable.
The individual man may set
the impossible before him as something
to be obtained, but I think
those communities of men have prospered
the best who have aimed at
what is possible. We see daily illustrations
of that, and anybody who
has studied the history of France
would be convinced that, though
England has a form of Government
not so free as that country, yet you
have made a greater advance towards
good will among men and towards
peace than France has done. I do
not wish you to suppose that I am
out of sympathy with what I call the
French Revolution—although I consider
it an enormous misfortune,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
which might have been prevented,
and France saved from many evil
consequences that followed—but the
manner in which it took place we
ought all to regard.</p>

<p>Since I have been in England I
have done something, I trust, to promote
a cordial feeling between this
country and the United States. That
has been my earnest desire always,
and I hope I have to some extent
succeeded. You will allow me to
thank you warmly for this address,
which I shall always feel to be among
my most precious possessions, and I
shall carry to the workmen on the
other side of the Atlantic the message
expressive of your sympathy
and hope. I hope the occasion will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
not ever arise even for arbitration.
I think if we can talk together face
to face we shall be able to settle all
differences. I am certain that the
relations between the two countries
are now of a most amicable and
friendly kind, and I am sure that my
successor is as strongly impressed as
I could be with the necessity of
strengthening those friendly relations.
I trust the necessity for arbitration
may never arise between us;
I do not think it will.</p>

<p>You will again allow me to give you
my most hearty and profound thanks
for the kindness you have done me and
to wish you all manner of prosperity. I
trust also that that reign of peace to
which you allude may come soon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
last long. I appreciate extremely
what Mr. Cremer said as to your
sympathy with the Northern States
in the Civil War, with whom no one
could help sympathizing if they went
to the root of the matter. I believe
in peace as strongly as any man can
do, but I believe also that there are
occasions when war is less disastrous
than peace; that there are times
when one must resort to what goes
before all law, and what, indeed,
forms the foundation of it—the law
of the strongest; and that, as a general
rule, the strongest deserve to get
the best of the struggle. They say
satirically that God is on the side of
the strong battalions, but I think they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
are sometimes in the right, and my
experience goes to prove that.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap tall">AT A ROYAL ACADEMY DINNER.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">O<span class="smcap">n</span> Saturday evening, May 3, 1886,
the annual dinner of the Royal Academy
was held at Burlington House, the
chair being occupied by the president, Sir
Frederic Leighton. On his right hand
were the Prince of Wales, and the Duke
of Cambridge, Prince Christian, Prince
Henry of Battenberg, the Duke of Teck,
the Lord Chancellor, and the Archbishop
of York; and on his left hand were
Prince Albert Victor of Wales, the
Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, the Italian
Ambassador, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowell</span>, in responding for “Literature,”
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Your Royal Highnesses, My
Lords, and Gentlemen</span>,—I think I
can explain who the artist might have
been who painted the reversed rainbow
of which the professor has just spoken.
I think, after hearing the too friendly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
remarks made about myself, that he
was probably some artist who was to
answer for his art at a dinner of the
Royal Society (<i>laughter</i>); and, naturally,
instead of painting the bow of
hope, he painted the reverse, the bow
of despair. (<i>Laughter.</i>) When I
received your invitation, Mr. President,
to answer for “Literature,” I
was too well aware of the difficulties
of your position not to know that
your choice of speakers must be
guided much more by the necessities
of the occasion than by the laws of
natural selection. (<i>Laughter and
cheers.</i>) I remembered that the
dictionaries give a secondary meaning
to the phrase “to answer for,”
and that is the meaning which implies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
some expedient for an immediate
necessity, as for example, when one
takes shelter under a tree from a
shower one is said to make the tree
answer for an umbrella. (<i>Laughter.</i>)
I think even an umbrella in the form
of a tree has certainly one very great
advantage over its artificial namesake—viz.,
that it cannot be borrowed
(<i>laughter</i>), not even for the exigencies
for which the instrument made
of twilled silk is made use of, as those
certainly will admit who have ever
tried it during one of those passionate
paroxysms of weather to which the
Italian climate is unhappily subject.
(<i>Laughter.</i>) I shall not attempt to
answer for literature, for it appears to
me that literature, of all other things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
is the one which is most naturally expected
to answer for itself. It seems
to me that the old English phrase
with regard to a man in difficulties,
which asks “What is he going to do
about it?” perhaps should be replaced
in this period of ours, when the foundations
of everything are being sapped
by universal discussion, with the more
pertinent question, “What is he
going to say about it?” (<i>“Hear,
hear,” and laughter.</i>) I suppose that
every man sent into the world with
something to say to his fellow men
could say it better than anyone else
if he could only find out what it was.
(<i>Laughter.</i>) I am sure that the
ideal after-dinner speech is waiting
for me somewhere with my address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
upon it, if I could only be so lucky
as to come across it. (<i>Laughter.</i>)
I confess that hard necessity, or perhaps,
I may say, too soft good nature,
has compelled me to make so many
unideal ones that I have almost exhausted
my natural stock of universally
applicable sentiment and my acquired
provision of anecdote and
allusion. (<i>Laughter.</i>) I find myself
somewhat in the position of
Heine, who had prepared an elaborate
oration for his first interview
with Goethe, and when the awful
moment arrived could only stammer
out that the cherries on the road to
Weimar were uncommonly fine.
(<i>Laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>But, fortunately, the duty which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
given to me to-night is not so onerous
as might be implied in the sentiment
which has called me up. I am consoled
not only by the lexicographer
as to the meaning of the phrase “to
answer for,” but also by an observation
of mine, which is that speakers
on an occasion like this are not always
expected to allude except in
distant and vague terms to the subject
on which they are specially supposed
to talk. Now, I have a more
pleasing and personal duty, it appears
to me, on this my first appearance
before an English audience on my
return to England. It gives me
great pleasure to think that in calling
upon me, you call upon me as representing
two things which are exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
dear to me, and which are very
near to my heart. One is that I
represent in some sense the unity of
English literature under whatever
sky it may be produced (<i>cheers</i>); and
the other is that I represent also that
growing friendliness of feeling, based
on a better understanding of each
other, which is growing up between
the two branches of the British stock.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) I could wish that my excellent
successor here as American
Minister could fill my place to-night,
for I am sure that he is as fully inspired
as I ever was with a desire to
draw closer the ties of friendship between
the mother and daughter, and
could express it in a more eloquent
and more emphatic manner than even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
I myself could do,—at any rate in a
more authoritative manner.</p>

<p>For myself I have only to say that
I come back from my native land
confirmed in my love of it and in
my faith in it. I come back also full
of warm gratitude for the feeling that
I find in England; I find in the old
home a guest chamber prepared for
me and a warm welcome. (<i>Cheers.</i>)
Repeating what his Royal Highness
the commander-in-chief has said, that
every man is bound in duty if he were
not bound in affection and loyalty to
put his own country first, I may be
allowed to steal a leaf out of the book
of my adopted fellow-citizens in
America; and while I love my native
country first, as is natural, I may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
allowed to say I love the country
next best which I cannot say has
adopted me, but which I will say has
treated me with such kindness, where
I have met with such universal kindness
from all classes and degrees of
people, that I must put that country
at least next in my affection.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) I will not detain you
longer. I know that the essence of
speaking here is to be brief, but I
trust I shall not lay myself open to
the reproach that in my desire to be
brief I have resulted in making myself
obscure. (<i>Laughter.</i>) I hope
I have expressed myself explicitly
enough; but I would venture to give
another translation of Horace’s words,
and say that I desire to be brief, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
therefore I efface myself. (<i>Laughter
and cheers.</i>)</p>

<p class="center allsmcap tall">AT THE STRATFORD MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN
PRESENTATION.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> memorial fountain presented to
Stratford-on-Avon by Mr. George
W. Childs, of Philadelphia, was inaugurated
Monday, October 17, 1887. Mr.
<span class="smcap">James Russell Lowell</span> sent the following
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I should more deeply regret my
inability to be present at the interesting
ceremonial of the 17th were it
not that my countrymen will be more
fitly and adequately represented there
by their accomplished Minister, Mr.
Phelps. The occasion is certainly a
most interesting one. The monument
which you accept to-day in behalf
of your townsmen commemorates
at once the most marvellous of Englishmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and the jubilee year of the
august lady whose name is honored
wherever the language is spoken, of
which he was the greatest master.
No symbol could more aptly serve
this double purpose than a fountain,
for surely no poet ever poured forth
so broad a river of speech as he,
whether he was the author of the
“Novum Organum” also or not. Nor
could the purity of her character and
example be better typified than by
the current that shall flow forever
from the sources opened here to-day.
It was Washington Irving who first
embodied in his delightful English
the emotion which Stratford-on-Avon
awakes in the heart of the pilgrim,
and especially of the American pilgrim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
who visits it. I am glad to
think that this memorial should be
the gift of an American and thus
serve to recall the kindred blood of
two great nations, joint heirs of the
same noble language and of the genius
that has given it a cosmopolitan significance.
I am glad of it because it
is one of the multiplying signs that
those two nations are beginning to
think more and more of the
things in which they sympathize and
less and less of those in which they
differ. A common language is not
indeed, the surest bond of amity, for
this enables each country to understand
whatever unpleasant thing the
other may chance to say about it.</p>

<p>As I am one of those who believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
that an honest friendship between
England and America is a most desirable
thing, I trust that we shall on
both sides think it equally desirable
in our intercourse one with another
to make our mother tongue search
her coffers round for the polished
rather than the sharp-cornered epithets
she has stored there. Let us by all
means speak the truth to each other,
for there is no one else who can speak
it to either of us with such a fraternal
instinct for the weak point of the
other; but let us do it in such wise
as to show that it is the truth we love
and not the discomfort we can inflict
by means of it. Let us say agreeable
things to each other and of each
other whenever we conscientiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
can. My friend, Mr. Childs, has said
one of these agreeable things in a
very solid and durable way. A common
literature and a common respect
for certain qualities of character and
ways of thinking supply a neutral
ground where we may meet in the
assurance that we shall find something
amiable in each other, and from being
less than kind become more than kin.</p>

<p>In old maps the line which outlined
British possessions in America
included the greater part of what is
now territory of the United States.
The possessions of the American in
England are laid down on no map,
yet he holds them in memory and
imagination by a title such as no conquest
ever established and no revolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
can ever overthrow. The dust
that is sacred to you is sacred to him.
The annals which Shakspeare makes
walk before us in flesh and blood
are his no less than yours. These
are the ties which we recognize, and
are glad to recognize, on occasions like
this. They will be yearly drawn
closer as science goes on with her
work of abolishing time and space,
and thus render more easy that peaceful
commerce ’twixt dividable shores
which is so potent to clear away whatever
is exclusive in nationality or
savors of barbarism in patriotism.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap tall">AT THE DINNER TO AMERICAN
AUTHORS.</p>


<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="center">he</span> dinner of the Incorporated Society
of Authors, on July 25, 1888,
was given to the “American Men and
Women of Letters” who happened to
be in London on that date. Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowell</span>
spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I confess that I rise under a certain
oppression. There was a time when
I went to make an after-dinner speech
with a light heart, and when on my
way to the dinner I could think over
my exordium in my cab and trust to
the spur of the moment for the rest
of my speech. But I find as I grow
older a certain aphasia overtakes me,
a certain inability to find the right
word precisely when I want it; and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
find also that my flank becomes less
sensitive to the exhilarating influences
of that spur to which I have just alluded.
I had pretty well made up
my mind not to make any more after-dinner
speeches. I had an impression
that I had made quite enough of
them for a wise man to speak, and
perhaps more than it was profitable
for other wise men to listen to. I
confess that it was with some reluctance
that I consented to speak at all
to-night. I had been bethinking me
of the old proverb of the pitcher and
well which is mentioned, as you remember,
in the proverb; and it was
not altogether a consolation to me to
think that that pitcher, which goes
once too often to the well, belongs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the class which is taxed by another
proverb with too great length of ears.
But I could not resist. I certainly
felt that it was my duty not to refuse
myself to an occasion like this—an
occasion which deliberately emphasizes,
as well as expresses, that good
feeling between our two countries
which, I think, every good man in
both of them is desirous to deepen
and to increase. If I look back to
anything in my life with satisfaction,
it is to the fact that I myself have, in
some degree, contributed—and I
hope I may believe the saying to be
true—to this good feeling. You
alluded, Mr. Chairman, to a date
which gave me, I must confess, what
we call on the other side of the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
“a rather large contract.” I am to reply,
I am to answer to literature, and
I must confess that a person like myself,
who first appeared in print fifty
years ago, would hardly wish to be
answerable for all his own literature,
not to speak of the literature of other
people. But your allusion to sixty
years ago reminded me of something
which struck me as I looked down
these tables.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago the two authors
you mentioned, Irving and Cooper,
were the only two American authors
of whom anything was known in
Europe, and the knowledge of them
in Europe was mainly confined to
England. It is true that Bryant’s
“Water-Fowl” had already begun its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
flight in immortal air, but these were
the only two American authors that
could be said to be known in England.
And what is even more remarkable,
they were the only American authors
at that time—there were, and had
been, others known to us at home—who
were capable of earning their
bread by their pens. Another singular
change is suggested to me as I
look down these tables, and that is
the singular contrast they afford between
the time when Johnson wrote
his famous lines about those ills that
assail the life of the scholar, and by
the scholar he meant the author—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the gaol.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">And I confess when I remember that
verse it strikes me as a singular contrast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
that I should meet with a body
of authors who are able to offer a
dinner instead of begging one; that
I have sat here and seen “forty feeding
like one,” when one hundred
years ago the one fed like forty when
he had the chance. You have alluded
also, in terms which I shall not
qualify, to my own merits. You have
made me feel a little as if I were a
ghost revisiting the pale glimpses of
the moon, and reading with considerable
wonder my own epitaph. But
you have done me more than justice
in attributing so much to me with regard
to International Copyright. You
are quite right in alluding to Mr.
Putnam, who, I think, wrote the best
pamphlet that has been written on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the subject; and there are others you
did not name who also deserve far
more than I do for the labor they
have expended and the zeal they have
shown on behalf of International
Copyright, particularly the secretaries
of our international society—Mr.
Lathrop and Mr. G. W. Green. And
since I could not very well avoid
touching upon the subject of International
Copyright, I must say that
all American authors without exception
have been in favor of it on the
moral ground, on the ground of simple
justice to English authors. But
there were a great many local, topical
considerations, as our ancestors used
to call them, that we were obliged to
take into account, and which, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
you do not feel as keenly here
as we did. But I think we may say
that the almost unanimous conclusion
of American authors latterly has been
that we should be thankful to get any
bill that recognized the principle of
international copyright, being confident
that its practical application
would so recommend it to the American
people that we should get afterwards,
if not every amendment of it
that we desire, at least every one that
is humanly possible. I think that
perhaps a little injustice has been
done to our side of the question; I
think a little more heat has been imported
into it than was altogether
wise. I am not so sure that our
American publishers were so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
more wicked than their English
brethren would have been if they had
had the chance. I cannot, I confess,
accept with patience any imputation
that implies that there is anything in
our climate or in our form of government
that tends to produce a lower
standard of morality than in other
countries. The fact is that it has
been partly due to a certain—may I
speak of our ancestors as having been
qualified by a certain dulness? I
mean no disrespect, but I think it is
due to the stupidity of our ancestors
in making a distinction between literary
property and other property.
That has been at the root of the whole
evil.</p>

<p>I, of course, understand, as everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
understands, that all property
is the creature of municipal law.
But you must remember that it is the
conquest of civilization, that when
property passes beyond the boundaries
of that <i lang="la">municipium</i> it is still
sacred. It is not even yet sacred in
all respects and conditions. Literature,
the property in an idea, has been
something that it is very difficult for
the average man to comprehend. It
is not difficult for the average man
to comprehend that there may be
property in a form which genius or
talent gives to an idea. He can see
it. It is visible and palpable, this
property in an idea when it is exemplified
in a machine, but it is hardly
so apprehensible when it is subtly interfused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
in literature. Books have
always been looked on somewhat as
<i lang="la">feræ naturæ</i>, and if you have ever
preserved pheasants you know that
when they fly over your neighbor’s
boundaries he may take a pot shot at
them. I remember that something
more than thirty years ago Longfellow,
my friend and neighbor, asked
me to come and eat a game pie with
him. Longfellow’s books had been
sold in England by the tens of thousands,
and that game pie—and you
will observe the felicity of its being a
game pie, <i lang="la">feræ naturæ</i> always you
see—was the only honorarium he
had ever received from this country
for reprinting his works. I cannot
help feeling as I stand here that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
is something especially—I might
almost use a cant word and say
monumentally—interesting in a meeting
like this. It is the first time that
English and American authors, so far
as I know, have come together in any
numbers, I was going to say to fraternize
when I remembered that I ought
perhaps to add to “sororize.” We,
of course, have no desire, no sensible
man in England or America has any
desire, to enforce this fraternization
at the point of the bayonet. Let us
go on criticising each other; it is
good for both of us. We Americans
have been sometimes charged with
being a little too sensitive; but perhaps
a little indulgence may be due
to those who always have their faults<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
told to them, and the reference to
whose virtues perhaps is sometimes
conveyed in a foot-note in small print.
I think that both countries have a
sufficiently good opinion of themselves
to have a fairly good opinion
of each other. They can afford it;
and if difficulties arise between the
two countries, as they unhappily may,—and
when you alluded just now to
what De Tocqueville said in 1828 you
must remember that it was only thirteen
years after our war,—you must
remember how long it has been to
get in the thin end of the wedge of
International Copyright; you must
remember it took our diplomacy
nearly one hundred years to enforce
its generous principle of the alienable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
allegiance, and that the greater part
of the bitterness which De Tocqueville
found in 1828 was due to the
impressment of American seamen,
of whom something like fifteen hundred
were serving on board English
ships when at last they were delivered.
These things should be remembered,
not with resentment but for enlightenment.
But whatever difficulties occurred
between the two countries,
and there may be difficulties that are
serious, I do not think there will be
any which good sense and good feeling
cannot settle. I think I have
been told often enough to remember
that my countrymen are apt to think
that they are in the right, that they
are always in the right; that they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
apt to look at their side of the question
only. Now, this conduces certainly
to peace of mind and imperturbability
of judgment, whatever other
merits it may have. I am sure I do
not know where we got it. Do you?
I also sympathize most heartily with
what has been said by the chairman
with regard to the increasing love for
England among my countrymen. I
find on inquiry that they stop longer
and in greater numbers every year in
the old home, and feel more deeply
its manifold charms. They also are
beginning to feel that London is the
centre of the races that speak English,
very much in the sense that
Rome was the centre of the ancient
world. And I confess that I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
think of London, which I also confess
that I love, without thinking of that
palace which David built, sitting in
hearing of a hundred streams—streams
of thought, of intelligence, of
activity. And one other thing about
London, if I may be allowed to refer
to myself, impresses me beyond any
other sound I have ever heard, and
that is the low, unceasing roar that
one hears always in the air. It is not
a mere accident, like the tempest or
the cataract, but it is impressive because
it always indicates human will
and impulse and conscious movement,
and I confess that when I hear it I
almost feel that I am listening to the
roaring loom of time. A few words
more. I will only say this, that we,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
as well as you, have inherited a common
trust in the noble language
which, in its subtle compositiveness,
is perhaps the most admirable instrument
of human thought and human
feeling and cunning that has ever
been unconsciously devised by man.
May our rivalries be in fidelity to
that trust. We have also inherited
certain traditions political and moral,
and in doing our duty towards these
it seems to me that we shall find
quite enough occupation for our
united thought and feeling.</p>

but it was a little volume of rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
immature poetry which some enthusiast
on this side of the water reprinted
privately. He was good
enough to send me a copy. Perhaps
it is known to you that we have a
protective system. (<i>Laughter</i>.) The
book was accordingly liable to duty
as coming to its author, and for the
information of whomsoever it might
concern there had been written on
the outside “Value <abbr title="six pence">6d.</abbr>” (<i>Laughter</i>.)
I laid it to heart at once, and I said
to myself, “Here is a piece of criticism
you can appreciate, and which,
perhaps, may do you a great deal of
good.” (<i>Laughter</i>.)</p>

<p>As I was saying, I do not intend
to make you any formal speech, and
I should not have come here had it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
not been that I think it the duty of
every man who can say anything that
affects the people, whether by his
pen or by his tongue, to go anywhere
where expression is given to the
friendly feeling which it is the desire
of all wise and all honest men, I
think, to deepen between the two
countries which you and I represent.
You have been good enough, Mr.
President, also to refer to my career
as a diplomatist in England, and you
were quite right in saying that it was
my endeavor to maintain those relations—those
friendly relations—and
I hope not without some success.
(<i>Cheers</i>.) But I cannot listen to this
compliment, I cannot accept it, without
saying that I was followed by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
American representative who has the
same feeling, and who has represented
America as ably in my judgment as
she was ever represented in England.
(<i>Cheers</i>.) That reminds me that we
have been rather remarkably represented
here in England. If you look
over the list of our Ministers you will
find that we have had three Adamses,
one after the other, grandfather,
father and son—one of the most
really striking instances of heredity I
know of (<i>laughter</i>); and the last Mr.
Adams wore at the Court of Queen
Victoria, as he told me, the regalia in
which his grandfather was robed
when he made his bow before George
III. as the first American Minister
in England, and was, I am bound to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
say, very civilly received by His
Majesty. (<i>Laughter.</i>) Those are
only three illustrations, but we have
many others. We have had Galitz,
for instance, a prominent American
diplomatist—though he was not an
American by birth, but was a naturalized
Swiss.</p>

<p>There has been lately—I am not
going to say a word about politics; I
always rigidly avoid them—but I
have seen a number of allusions in
the newspapers lately to a certain
tension, as the journalists like to call
it, between the two countries. I
cannot help thinking it is the result
of a little irritation on both sides;
but I have always felt that nothing
was more foolish and that nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
ought to be more rigidly left to children
than the “You’re another.”
(<i>Laughter and cheers.</i>) Now, I dare
say metaphysically, you are another;
but there are occasions when the telling
one that he is “another” is apt to
have a disastrous effect, and I think
we ought to avoid it. (<i>Cheers.</i>)
When we look at the enormous extension
of the race which speaks
English (as we call it, for I am always
desirous to avoid confining it to the
English race, as we used to term it
in our pride); when we consider this
growth (though I do not quite agree
with the figures of some of my friends,
I do not believe we shall be a population
of one hundred millions or two
hundred millions so soon as is expected);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
when we consider this
growth we find a remarkable fact,
and one which no thoughtful man can
help observing and reflecting upon.
England is the greatest of colonizing
races. This is a great distinction,
and ennobles a nation. England has
put a girdle of three prosperous and
vigorous communities around the
globe. Of course, it is not for me to
say a word about Imperial federation.
I am not sure Imperial federation
would be a good thing. I am not
sure, even if it were a good thing, it
is not a dream. It is not for me to
say; but it seems to me nobody who
looks far can help seeing that the
time may not be far distant when the
good understanding among all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
English-speaking people and their
enormous resources may have great
weight in deciding the destinies of
mankind. (<i>Cheers.</i>) Now, I am one
of those who believe that civilization
and freedom are better married than
divided, that they go better together.
Nobody who has studied history
would say they do not exist apart, but
it is in divorce, and each is the worse
for it. (<i>Cheers.</i>) The duty which
has been laid upon the English-speaking
races, so far as we can discover,
has been to carry ever the great
lessons of liberty combined with
order. (<i>Cheers.</i>) That is the great
secret of civilization. We may have
our different laws and different forms
of government; but so long as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
sympathize with any idea that so far
transcends all geographical boundaries
and all municipal limits as that,
I think you will agree with me that
nothing can be more important than
to preserve the friendliest relations
between the two greatest representatives
of this conquering and colonizing
race. (<i>Cheers.</i>)</p>

<p>I did not intend to detain you so
long as I have (<i>cries of “Go on”</i>),
but I have also in my experience of
after-dinner speeches observed that
a speech is like an ill-broken horse;
it is apt to take the bit between its
teeth and to bolt at the most unexpected
moment. A speaker frequently
brings up, not where he intended
to bring up, but where his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
steed chooses to land him. I suppose
that before coming here I ought to
have studied carefully the history of
Liverpool, with which I ought to have
appeared to have been familiar from
my earliest childhood. (<i>Laughter.</i>)
Unfortunately, there was no history
of Liverpool in my friend Tom
Brown’s library. (<i>Laughter.</i>) There
were histories of inferior places—Chester,
and so on—but no history
of Liverpool; and I therefore cannot
give you a great deal of information
which I have no doubt would have
been new and very interesting to you,
and which would make the staple of
a proper after-dinner speech. But
there is one thing I remember about
Liverpool. I have always felt a sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
of literary gratitude to Liverpool,
strange as you may think it. In my
father’s library I remember very well
three quarto volumes stood side by
side more years ago than I like to
say. Two of these volumes were
“Lorenzo the Magnificent,” and the
other was “Poggio Bracciolini.” I, of
course, when I was a boy, did not
know precisely the meaning of those
books; but they did to a certain extent
afford me an introduction to the
“Renaissance in Italy.” I thought—but
Sir James Picton corrects me—that
it was Roscoe who translated
the life of the second Lorenzo; but
it was his son, I am informed, who
translated another book which gave
me my first acquaintance with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Italian Novelists, and which was a
book which I remember buying when
I was making a library of my own
very early in life.</p>

<p>But to an American Liverpool
generally represents the gate by
which he enters the Old World; for
as our ancestors went across West to
find a new world there in that unexplored
Atlantic, as they thought it
might be, we go back Eastward to
find our new world in the old—a new
world of continental instruction and
freshness. And I am glad, linked as
we are in history and speaking, as I
am given to understand, a language
which at least can be understood the
one by the other (<i>laughter</i>)—I am
glad to find that my countrymen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
linger more and more in the land of
their ancestors. Formerly Bristol
was the great port through which intercourse
with America was kept up,
but now certainly Liverpool is one
end of the three-thousand-mile loom
on which the shuttles which are binding
us all in visible ties more and
more together are continually shooting
to and fro. Liverpool is also the
gate by which Americans leave the
Old World to go home, and I am to a
certain extent, as a person who
crosses the seas not infrequently, interested
in a discussion which I saw
in the newspapers the other day as
to the difficulties of embarcation at
Liverpool. But I have encountered
one which I did not expect, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
difficulty has been put in my way by
the Philomathic Society. You have
made it harder to get away from
Liverpool than I should have expected
or supposed, and I shall carry
away with me when I go to-morrow
the recollections of this pleasant
meeting with you, of its cordiality, of
the pleasant things that have been
said to me, and that we often accept
things that we do not deserve.
